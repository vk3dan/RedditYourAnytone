# reddityouranytone

This is a tool to fetch DMR ID database, convert it to Anytone D868/D878 CPS format and add known redditor u/names to the list so that this info is on the radio screen. It may work also on B-Tech DMR-6x2.

This tool is written in python and requires pandas

TODO: keep city or state data from DB when reddit data is incomplete.
